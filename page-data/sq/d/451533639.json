You can go back with `ctrl+-`. Here, go to your [[inbox]]\n\n- [ ] to see how your notes are connected, execute the `Foam: Show Graph` command. See [[graph-visualization]].\n\n- [ ] #tags can be used to further organize your content. Look at the `Tag Explorer` view on the left panel to find and navigate the tags in your knowledge base. See [[tags-and-tag-explorer]].\n\n- [ ] Foam supports [[spell-checking]].\n\n- [ ] You can also paste images in your Foam, just press `cmd+alt+v` to create the image file and link to it from your note. See [[paste-images-from-clipboard]].\n\n- [ ] You can use Foam for your daily notes, or journaling. Execute now the `Foam: Open Daily Note` command to create a new file in your `journal` folder. See [[daily-notes]].\n\n- [ ] Want to see how to manage your tasks? Go to the [[todo]] note\n\n- [ ] The section at the end of this file contains wikilink definitions, which enable navigation of your notes from GitHub's web UI, and in general to make `[[wikilinks]]` understood by any markdown parser. See [[link-reference-definitions]].\n\n- [ ] To explore all the Foam settings, press `cmd+,`, then `Extensions > Foam`\n\n- [ ] Living within VsCode, Foam can be customized in many ways! Look at the [Foam Recipes](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes/recipes) for ideas!\n\n- [ ] Join the [Foam community on Discord](https://foambubble.github.io/join-discord/e), introduce yourself and leave a message on how you found Foam and how the onboarding went :) We are always keen to do better\n\n- [ ] Take the [Foam Welcome survey](http://foambubble.github.io/welcome-survey/e)! It helps us better understand your need and how we can make Foam better and better for you :)\n\n## Advanced Features\n\n- [ ] You can create [[note-templates]] for things like book reviews, people, daily notes (coming soon), and more!\n\n## About Foam\n\nFoam doesn't do all this magic on its own, it relies on some amazing extensions.
